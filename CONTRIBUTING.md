# Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have any ideas or improvements, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.

Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Open an Issue**: If you find a bug, have a suggestion, or want to discuss something, open an issue on GitHub. Provide as much detail as possible to help us understand the problem or enhancement you're proposing.
2. **Create a Pull Request**: If you'd like to contribute code, fork the repository, create a new branch, and make your changes. Once you're ready, submit a pull request. Be sure to describe your changes in detail and reference any related issues.
3. **Review Pull Requests**: Help review open pull requests by testing changes, providing feedback, and approving or suggesting improvements.
4. **Spread the Word**: Share the project with others who might be interested. The more people who use and contribute to the project, the better it becomes!

Happy coding!
